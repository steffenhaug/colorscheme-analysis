# Color Scheme Analysis
This is a julia package to analyze colorschemes.
It currently supports defining color schemes as splines in hue-chroma (2D) space,
with a linear increase in brightness.
It implements plots found in Peter Kovesis paper on perceptually uniform colorschemes using Makie.

## TODO
- Catmull-Rom splines through LCHab
- Catmull-Rom loops for cyclical colorschemes
